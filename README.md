## Key Features

### 🏙️ Interactive Graph Visualization

- **Zoom**: see the issue in all details or zoom out and see the general overview

  Double-clicking the issue will open them in a new tab.

- **Dependency Tracking**: Visual arrows clearly show `blocks`, `is_blocked_by`, and `related_to` relationships.

- **Coloring**: Nodes are color-coded by status (To Do, In Progress, Done) or customized based on your view settings.

- **Color Legend**

### 🔍 Powerful Filtering & Search
Slice and dice your data to find exactly what you need.
- **Multi-faceted Filtering**: Filter by Label, Author, Assignee, Milestone, Priority, Type, and more.

- **Deep Search**: Instantly find issues by ID, title, or content.

- **Date Filters**: Filter by Created / Updated / Due Date with `after`, `before`, `between`, and `last X days`.

### 📊 Advanced Grouping & Layouts
Organize the chaos.
- **Smart Grouping**: Cluster nodes by Status, Assignee, Author, Milestone, or any scoped label (e.g., `Priority::*`, `Type::*`).

- **Customizable Physics**: Tweak gravity, repulsion, link strength/distance, friction, and optional grid magnet in real-time.

### 💾 Productivity Tools

- **Preset sharing**: Copy/paste presets as JSON via clipboard (handy for sharing setups with teammates).

- **Custom Presets**: Save your complex filter and view configurations as named presets for quick access.

- **Built-in presets** (one-click starting points):

  - **Priorities**: Colors issues by Priority.
  - **Blocking Issues**: Focuses on priority `0 - Blocking` issues.
  - **By me**: Shows issues authored by you (`@me`) using a timeline-style view.
  - **Assigned to me**: Shows issues assigned to you (`@me`) using a timeline-style view.
  - **Links**: Emphasizes dependency links (good for visualizing connections).
  - **Labels**: Colors + groups by Label.
  - **Authors**: Colors + groups by Author.
  - **Assignees**: Colors + groups by Assignee.
  - **Milestones**: Colors + groups by Milestone.
  - **Issue Types**: Colors + groups by Type.
  - **New Tickets (60d)**: Shows recently created issues (last 60 days), grouped by Author.
  - **Updated (30d)**: Shows recently updated issues (last 30 days), grouped by Author.
  - **Ticket Age**: Buckets by staleness / last-updated age for spotting stale tickets.
  - **timeline - created**: Timeline view grouped by Created date.
  - **timeline - updated**: Timeline view grouped by Updated date.

- **Dark/Light Mode**: precise support for Light, Dark, and System themes.

  </div>

- **Context Menu**: rich context menu for issues

- **Editing support**: You can open/close, assign yourself or unassign yourself right now:

- **Local caching**: Local caching ensures your graph loads instantly on reloads/F5.

  <img src="misc/cache.png" />

- **Backup / restore**: Export/import cached graph data as a `.json` file for backups or moving between machines.

- **Open behavior**: Choose whether opening an issue uses a new tab, a reusable tab, or the current tab.

- **Support diagnostics**: One-click “Copy diagnostics” for bug reports (version + platform + recent warnings/errors).

- **Single page application**: One HTML page, no server needed


### 🔥 Flake History (optional integration)

GitLabViz can also render a heatmap and leaderboard of your test suite's flake history when a compatible JSON bundle is published as a GitLab Generic Package. Bring your own bundler that emits the public [`flake-history-bundle.v1`](docs/flake-history-bundle.v1.schema.json) shape and point the **Flake History source** settings panel at the package — see [docs/flake-history-integration.md](docs/flake-history-integration.md) for the schema, fetch contract, and a copy-paste `curl` example for a minimal producer.


## Getting Started

Download the html from above and open it :)

## Prerequisites / Compatibility

- **GitLab**: Works with **GitLab.com (cloud)** and **self-managed/hosted GitLab** as long as the **REST API v4** is available (the app uses `/api/v4/...` endpoints like issues + issue links). Practically, that means **GitLab 11.0+** (API v3 was removed in 11.0, leaving v4 as the supported REST API).
- **Token**: A **Personal Access Token** is required. Recommended scopes:
  - **Read-only** (viewing): **`read_api`** (+ **`read_user`** for the “By me / Assigned to me” presets)
  - **Editing** (close/reopen, assign/unassign from context menu): **`api`**
- **Network access**: Your machine must be able to reach your GitLab API URL (company VPN / firewall rules apply).

## Privacy / Data Handling

- **No backend**: GitLab Viz runs entirely in your browser. There is no GitLab Viz server. All data lives in your browser cache and is never sent anywhere.
- **Network requests**: **GitLab**: When enabled, the app calls your configured GitLab API URL directly from your machine and renders the data locally.
- **Local storage**: Settings and cached graph data are stored in your browser storage (IndexedDB via `localforage`) under keys like `settings`, `gitlab_nodes`, `gitlab_edges`, `gitlab_meta`.


## Security Notes

- Treat your **GitLab token** like a password.
- **Token-at-rest obfuscation**: The GitLab token is stored **obfuscated** using **XOR + base64** with a fixed app key. This is **not encryption** and only helps against casual inspection of backups/local storage.
- On shared machines, prefer using the browser build in a separate profile and clear site data when done.

## Development
