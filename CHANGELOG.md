# Changelog

## [0.10.7] - 2026-05-14
- Fix: kiosk now operates on the full ticket set instead of inheriting the main sidebar's filters. Click-throughs in earlier sessions left `includeClosed: false` (or other) on the sidebar; closed tickets were never reaching the kiosk dashboard. Kiosk owns its own filters (target milestone / priority / stale / backlog) so the sidebar doesn't need to scope it any more.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-05-14
- Fix: kiosk Priority filter was hiding closed tickets that had no Priority:: label, making the closed counts and velocity / activity feeds collapse. The filter now applies to open tickets only — same treatment as the Stale and Exclude-Backlog filters — so closed work still shows up as historical events.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-05-14
- Kiosk polish pass:
  - Every big number now uses thousands separators (`1,799` instead of `1799`) so totals are easier to read from across the room.
  - Today's pulse, Target stats, and Risks cards each get a small `mdi-` icon in the corner (plus / check / trending / pencil / sigma / account-off / calendar-question) for instant scanning.
  - Workload rows now show a colored initials avatar next to each name (same hashed-color pattern as the activity feed) so people are recognizable without reading.
  - Priority / Status / Type / Hot labels / Aging bar lists got a `% of total` side column so the relative share of each bucket is visible alongside the absolute count.
  - Velocity highlights the rightmost "Today" bar with a dashed primary border so the current day reads instantly.
  - Empty states are friendlier: 48px `mdi-` icon + centered text (e.g., `No blockers — clear sailing` with `mdi-check-decagram-outline`).

## [0.10.4] - 2026-05-14
- Kiosk global filters (Stale threshold, Exclude Backlog, Priority filter, Target milestone) now affect **every** kiosk screen — including target focus, burnup chart, milestone progress, today's pulse, velocity, recent activity feed, recently closed, blockers, stale WIP, etc. Previously stale + backlog only applied to count modes. Config hints updated to reflect the new global scope.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-05-14
- Burnup chart overhaul:
  - **Smart window** — anchors to the milestone's `start_date` only when it's within 2× the configured window (default 90 days, configurable). Otherwise rolls back from the due date, or falls back to recent activity. Tickets that pre-date the window become a Day-1 baseline so the chart starts at meaningful counts instead of zero.
  - **Ideal-burn guideline** — dashed white line from `(start, baseline-closed)` to `(due, scope)`, the visual target a developer can compare the green line against from across the room.
  - **Risk-zone fill** — open work area between scope and closed is amber by default; turns red when closures lag the ideal line by 15+ tickets, so "we're behind" jumps out.
  - **On-track / behind ideal burn** label in the legend.
- Note: chart lines are reconstructed from each ticket's `created_at` / `closed_at` — there are no daily historical snapshots, so retroactive label / milestone changes can't be reconstructed.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-05-14
- Burnup chart now anchors the X axis to the earliest ticket creation instead of the milestone's `start_date`. Re-used / old milestones often have a `start_date` years before the first real ticket lands, which left 99% of the chart flat at zero. The "Due" marker label is also offset below the "Today" label so they don't sit on top of each other when both fall near the chart's right edge.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-05-14
- New global kiosk **Priority filter** (Configuration → Kiosk → Active filter). Pick any combination of Blocking / High / Medium / Low / Other / No priority — when set, every kiosk mode counts only those tickets. Pair it with the target milestone for a "blocking work for v0.39" wall. Header shows an orange `Blocking + High` chip when active, and deep-link click-throughs carry the filter into the main graph too.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-14
- Target milestone screen: **rich segmented progress bar**. Three segments — green = closed, grey = open from the original scope (tickets created on/before milestone start_date), striped amber = scope creep (tickets added after start). Tiny legend underneath shows the counts. Falls back to a 2-segment view when the milestone has no `start_date`.
- New kiosk mode **Milestone burnup** — classic agile cumulative flow chart. Two lines (indigo "scope" / green "closed") with the open work shaded between them, vertical "Today" and "Due" markers, and date / count axes. Built as inline SVG so it scales cleanly to any kiosk screen.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-05-14
- Fix: false "Share URL: Unknown URL key 'paused' — ignored." warning that popped up when entering kiosk mode. The main view's share-codec was running on kiosk's URL args (`paused` / `cycle` / `refresh`) which don't belong to it; gated decode + encode on `activePage === 'main'`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-05-14
- New kiosk mode **Stale WIP** — open tickets in "In progress" / "Doing" / "WIP" status that haven't been updated in N days (default 5). Amber theme, sorted by longest-idle first. Great for surfacing forgotten work in stand-ups.
- **Workload by assignee** bars are now **stacked by priority** (Blocking / High / Medium / Low / Other / No priority), so you can see at a glance who's drowning in critical work vs. routine items. Toggle off in Configuration → Kiosk if you prefer plain bars.
- **Status breakdown** now shows the **average idle days** per status — surfaces review / QA queue bottlenecks (e.g., "Ready for Review: 35 · avg idle 8d"). Red when > 14 days.
- **Blockers** mode: new "Only show blockers ≤ N days old" config — pair it with the default list to flip between fresh-blockers and the legacy long-tail.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-14
- Target milestone screen redesigned:
  - **ETA banner** — projects when the milestone will land using the last 14 days of closure / add rate. Color-coded: green "on track" with slack-days, red "X days late", amber "stalled" when scope is growing faster than closures, gold trophy "milestone complete", grey "no due date".
  - Stat cards now have rate sub-lines (closed last 14d · added last 14d · closed/wk vs added/wk).
  - Two new side-by-side panels: **Recently closed** and **Recently added** within the milestone (last 14 days, 6 each, clickable to open in GitLab).
  - Replaces the previous "Top open in milestone" list — use the Blockers / Activity modes for that.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-14
- When a target milestone is set, **the whole kiosk is now scoped to that milestone**. Today's pulse, velocity, workload, priority, status, type, hot labels, aging, activity, recently closed, blockers, and risks all only count tickets in that milestone. Milestone progress and the Target focus mode keep showing the full picture.
- The kiosk header shows a primary-colored flag chip with the active milestone name so it's obvious what's being filtered.
- Clicking through to the main graph from kiosk now also carries the milestone filter forward.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-05-14
- New kiosk mode **Hot labels** — plain labels appearing on tickets with any activity in the last 24h (configurable). Shows what topics the team is actually working on right now. Click a label to filter the graph by it.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-14
- Kiosk Recent activity: the right-side columns (comments, assignee, time) now line up neatly across rows instead of wobbling when a ticket has no comments or no assignee.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-14
- Configuration → Kiosk now has an "Open kiosk" button so you can preview the dashboard without leaving the page or remembering the hotkey.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-14
- Fix: graph legend no longer shows a horizontal scrollbar when label texts are long.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-14
- Two new kiosk modes (13 total):
  - **Blockers** — open tickets with blocking/critical priority, critical severity, or "blocked" status/label. Oldest first, red theme.
  - **Recently closed** — celebration view of tickets closed in the last 48h (configurable).

## [0.7.7] - 2026-05-14

- Four new kiosk modes: **Status breakdown**, **Type breakdown**, **Milestone progress**, **Aging buckets**.
- Per-mode options (velocity days window, workload top-N, activity feed size, etc.).
- Configuration → Kiosk redesigned with per-mode cards.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-14
- Kiosk: shareable URLs (`#/kiosk/<mode>/paused=1/cycle=10/refresh=2`). Mode, pause state, and cycle/refresh overrides all live in the URL.
